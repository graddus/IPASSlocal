# NetflixApp
A web application that showcases the tv series Netflix has to offer, as well as a calendar functionality to keep track of the latest episodes of the currently airing shows.

## Tools
The application uses a front-end that utilizes CSS, HTML5 and JavaScript. The application also uses a Java backend that communicates with a Database. The front-end communicates with the backend through REST calls. The application is currently hosted on http://netflix-app.herokuapp.com/, so if you want to check it out use that one with username: test and password: test.
